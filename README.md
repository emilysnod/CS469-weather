# BikePed Weather Data Management System

This is a tool for collecting weather data to be used in conjunction with the wealth of
other data that BikePed Portal collects.

There are two main components to this project, as well as some ancillary tools that were used for testing and may be useful in the future.

## Components

- **Front End**
    - This is intended to be used by a BikePed admin, not the general users of BikePed Portal. It is only necessary to use this frontend when trackers are being added to a completely new area, or when the current set of tracked weather is not precise enough.
        - Scenario 1: BikePed gets trackers in a city where it has never had trackers before. A BikePed admin would want to use the front end to add that city and its historical data as a location whose weather data to track.
        - Scenario 2: Since BikePed's Trackers tend to be clustered to certain cities and sometimes their suburbs, tracking the data for a station in that city tends to be sufficient. However, as new trackers are added and perhaps new clusters are formed, it may make sense to track the weather for a new station to get better data for that new cluster. This front end can be used to do that as well.
- **Back End/Scheduled Updates**
    - The functionality responsible for fetching the data when an admin chooses to add a station to track can also be scheduled, ensuring that the BikePed weather database is always up to date for the tracked stations.
    When the schedule task is run, it gets the latest weather data for all of the stations in the Weather_Stations table.
- **Ancillary tools**
    - NCEI Weather Data Downloader: This is a python script to download all of the CSV files that store hourly data that the NCEI stores. This was developed as a precaution to get the NCEI data backed up in case it stopped being publicly available for any reason at some point in the future
    - plotweather.py: This was developed to demonstrate plotting data from the NCEI CSV files. It currently hard codes the name of the file and specific dates to plot from that file.

## Best Practices
- **Weather Station Selection**
    - Enter a location on the main page. A city works best, and it does not need to be exact: 'New York', 'New york City', and 'NYC' all get good results for weather stations near New York, NY. Likewise, if the city name is ambiguous and you are looking for the less populous one, use the state name or abbreviation to find stations for that city (e.g. 'Portland' gives results for Portland, Oregon. Search 'Portland, ME' if that's the one you want).
    - Not every weather station has hourly data, and as there is not an API for accessing this data, the only way to tell is to just attempt to download the data for that station ID and see if it can be parsed, and sometimes one location will have multiple station IDs. That said, international airports pretty reliably have weather stations that keep this hourly data. So it is usually best to choose one of these in the results that get shown. 
    
## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (version 14.x or higher)
- PostgreSQL database
- Python 3.x (for data visualization scripts)
    - Only necessary for the data plotting script

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd project
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Configure environment variables**
   Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following variables:

   ```
   BIKEPED_DATABASE_URL=postgresql://<username>:<password>@portaldb.its.pdx.edu:5432/bikeped_capstone?sslmode=require
   PORT=3000
   ```

4. **Set up Python dependencies** (for visualization, generally not necessary for the main project.)
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Running the Application

### Development Mode

```bash
npm run dev
```

### Production Mode

```bash
npm start
```

### Debug Mode

```bash
npm run debug
```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:3000`

## Troubleshooting

### Database Connection Issues

If you encounter database connection errors:

1. **SSL Configuration**

   ```env
   BIKEPED_DATABASE_URL=postgresql://username:password@host:port/database?ssl=true
   ```

2. **Network Access**

   - Ensure you are connected the the MCECS network, either directly or via VPN

3. **Connection Testing**
   ```bash
   psql "postgresql://username:password@host:port/database?ssl=true"
   ```
